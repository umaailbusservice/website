        Umaail Bus Service began its journey in the late 2000s with a single bus and a humble contract in the garment industry. Our founder, Iqbal Ahmed Khan, built this company after dedicating 25 years of his life to the transport sector. Starting as a cleaner, then advancing to a driver, and later managing operations at a renowned transport company, Iqbal’s vision was rooted in providing safe, reliable, and efficient transportation for the people of Bengaluru.

His years of hard work and commitment to excellence laid the foundation for Umaail Bus Service. Today, what started as one bus has grown into a fleet of 70+ vehicles, transporting over 3,500 students and working with schools and corporates across the city. Now managed by his sons, Umar Khan and Ismail Khan, the company continues to uphold its core values of safety, comfort, and reliability in every journey.

With cutting-edge technology like GPS tracking, CCTV monitoring, and a highly trained team, we are proud to be one of Bengaluru’s leading transport service providers. We aim to make every trip a smooth and secure experience, ensuring peace of mind for both parents and institutions.
